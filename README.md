# Neovim + Lazyvim config

This is my personal Neovim config, based on the LazyVim. Its pre defined with some plugins for diverse things and I will be adding a few more as I go along.

My use case is mainly data science and backend development, unfornatly there isn't a good support for jupyter notebooks so its the only thing I don't code on this setup.

## Tasks

- Automate manim
- Change key binds for new line and commenting lines and closing getting out of terminal
